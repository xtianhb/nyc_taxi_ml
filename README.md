## NYC Taxi Fare and Trip Duration Prediction

![Taxi](taxi.png)

This project aims to leverage the vast amount of ride data in New York City to predict taxi ride fares and durations. The focus is on utilizing data available at the beginning of a ride, including pickup/dropoff coordinates, trip distance, start time, passenger count, and rate code (standard or airport). Predicting these factors can assist passengers in making informed commuting decisions and help drivers choose more profitable rides.

The project involves building predictive models trained on a dataset of NYC taxi rides, split into training and testing sets. Evaluation will be based on the model's accuracy in predicting fares and durations. Additionally, the project can extend to analyze factors impacting rides, such as traffic, weather, and road closures, providing insights for operational optimization and customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, the project explores the potential to predict taxi demand, assisting dispatchers in decision-making for profit margin improvement. In summary, it offers an opportunity to apply machine learning to real-world data, gaining valuable insights into NYC's transportation industry.
